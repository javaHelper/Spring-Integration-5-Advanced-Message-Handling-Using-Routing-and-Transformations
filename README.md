# Spring-Integration-5-Advanced-Message-Handling-Using-Routing-and-Transformations

# Message Router:
A messaging component that consumes a message from a message channel and republishes it to a different message channel depending 
on a set of condition.

# Message Router Types 
1) Payload Type Router - Routes based on message type
2) Header-Value Router - Routes based on header Value
3) Generic Router - Routes based on custom logic
4) Recipient List Router - Routes to multiple channel


Done and dusted.
